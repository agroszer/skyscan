scarping flights data to a sheet

Suppose you have a complex itinerary in a sheet.
Like you spend some weeks in Asia and have a few options in which order to visit regions.
Would be nice to have the flight prices automatically updated instead of manually
having to harvest from OTAs.

Seems like skyscanner and kiwi.com (former skypicker) have a neat API for this
